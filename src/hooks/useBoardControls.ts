/**
 * Board gestures, in two flavours that answer the same question — which lane.
 *
 * A swipe fires the moment it passes threshold rather than on release: at
 * 20 m/s, waiting for pointerup is a hit. The origin resets after each one so
 * a long drag can cross two lanes.
 *
 * A press that never swipes is a tap, and the side of the board it lands on
 * picks the direction — the half the thumb is already over. The whip moved to
 * its own button when the tap took this job, so nothing is overloaded.
